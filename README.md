This is my entry for Ludum Dare 42 game jam. This is my second time participating in the jam, although it is my first time doing it alone.


## About the Game

It's sort of like Tetris in terms of rules (clear when a row is filled etc), but you control a little avatar that indirectly moves the blocks. The game is slow paced to start, but sit through it and it gets more intense. Give the game a chance and I think you'll enjoy it.
